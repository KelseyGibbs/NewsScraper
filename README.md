  ## Assignment Overview
  
  "In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to   actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

  Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user.   Each scraped article should be saved to your application database. 

  Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to     the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All       stored comments should be visible to every user."
